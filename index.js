// Functional Tests

// Shopping Cart 

// - When the user presses the "Checkout" button, app checks to make sure that there are more than 0 items in the cart. 
// - If there are 0 items in the cart, app prompts the user to add items to the cart. 
// - If there are 1 or more items in the cart, app prompts the user to choose whether they would like to log in to an      account or check out as a guest. 
//      - If the user chooses to check out as a guest, app leads them to a page with a form that asks for name, address, phone number and email address inputs. 
//      - If the user chooses to log in, app takes them to a page that populates a form with name, address, phone number and email address data from the database's stored information.  
// - If any fields are missing, app prompts user to complete all fields before making "Continue to Checkout" button available. 
// - Once all fields are complete, app allows user to click "Continue to Checkout" button.
// - While taking user to next page, app calculates tax and shipping costs using the user's zip code.  
// - When user clicks "Continue to Checkout" button, app takes them to a new page that lists the user's information, the items in the cart, the subtotal for the items, the tax and shipping costs, and the final total. 
// - When user clicks "Confirm Order,"  all order/user information is sent to database.
